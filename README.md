## Project Setup<a name="project-setup"></a>
Start by setting up a new Next.js project with TypeScript support. You can use the following commands:

### Create a new Next.js project<a name="create-nextjs-project"></a>

```shell
npx create-next-app my-sudoku-game
```

### Install TypeScript support<a name="install-typescript-support"></a>

```shell
cd my-sudoku-game
touch tsconfig.json
```

Add the following content to `tsconfig.json`:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "jsx": "preserve",
    "lib": ["dom", "dom.iterable", "esnext"],
    "allowJs": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "strict": true,
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true,
    "noEmit": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "module": "esnext",
    "moduleResolution": "node",
    "resolveJsonModule": true,
    "isolatedModules": true,
    "jsxImportSource": "@emotion/react"
  },
  "include": ["next

-env.d.ts", "**/*.ts", "**/*.tsx"],
  "exclude": ["node_modules"]
}
```

### Install Prisma<a name="install-prisma"></a>

```shell
npm install prisma --save-dev
```

### Install Tailwind CSS<a name="install-tailwind-css"></a>
```shell
npm install tailwindcss
```

## Design and Layout<a name="design-and-layout"></a>
Plan the design and layout of your Sudoku game. Consider the following steps:

### Plan the game UI<a name="plan-game-ui"></a>
- Decide how the Sudoku grid will be displayed
- Determine the user interactions and additional features

### Create responsive layout using Tailwind CSS<a name="create-responsive-layout"></a>
- Set up Tailwind CSS in your project
- Design and style the Sudoku game UI using Tailwind CSS classes

## Game Logic<a name="game-logic"></a>
Implement the logic for generating and solving Sudoku puzzles. Consider the following steps:

### Generate a Sudoku puzzle<a name="generate-sudoku-puzzle"></a>
- Research existing libraries or algorithms for generating Sudoku puzzles
- Implement a Sudoku puzzle generator that produces solvable puzzles with a unique solution

### Solve Sudoku puzzles<a name="solve-sudoku-puzzles"></a>
- Explore solving algorithms such as backtracking or constraint propagation
- Implement a Sudoku puzzle solver that can find solutions efficiently

### Handle user input, error checking, and hints<a name="handle-user-input"></a>
- Create functions to handle user input and validate it against the puzzle rules
- Implement error checking to highlight incorrect entries
- Provide a hint system to guide the user when requested

## State Management<a name="state-management"></a>
Choose a state management solution for your application. Consider the following steps:

### Choose a state management solution<a name="choose-state-management"></a>
- Assess the complexity of your application and decide on the appropriate state management solution
- Options include React's built-in `useState`, Redux, Zustand, or others

### Manage game state and user progress<a name="manage-game-state"></a>
- Define the necessary state variables to track the current puzzle, user input, and game progress
- Implement the required logic to update and manage the game state based on user actions

## Database Integration<a name="database-integration"></a>
Use Prisma to set up a database to store game states, scores, or user progress. Consider the following steps:

### Set up a database using Prisma<a name="setup-database-prisma"></a>
- Configure Prisma to connect to your chosen database system (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL)
- Set up the necessary database credentials and connection details

### Define database schema and models<a name="define-database-schema"></a>
- Create Prisma models to represent game states, scores, or user progress
- Write appropriate Prisma migrations to create the required database tables

## User Authentication<a name="user-authentication"></a>
Implement user authentication if you want to provide features like saving game progress for registered users or multiplayer functionality. Consider the following steps:

### Implement user authentication<a name="implement-user-authentication"></a>
- Choose a user authentication library like NextAuth.js or Passport.js
- Set up authentication middleware and user management functionality

### Save game progress for registered users<a name="save-game-progress"></a>
- Link the user authentication system with the game state and database
- Store and retrieve game progress based on the authenticated user

## Game UI and Interactivity<a name="game-ui-and-interactivity"></a>
Build the Sudoku game UI using React components. Implement the interactivity for selecting cells, entering numbers, and interacting with the game board. Consider the following steps:

### Build Sudoku game

 UI using React components<a name="build-game-ui"></a>
- Create React components for the Sudoku grid, cells, and other UI elements
- Structure the components hierarchy to reflect the game layout

### Handle cell selection and number input<a name="handle-cell-selection"></a>
- Implement event handlers to handle cell selection and highlighting
- Enable user input of numbers and update the game state accordingly

## Game Completion and Validation<a name="game-completion-and-validation"></a>
Implement logic to check if the user has successfully completed the Sudoku puzzle. Consider the following steps:

### Check if the puzzle is successfully completed<a name="check-puzzle-completion"></a>
- Compare the user's input against the solution to determine if the puzzle is completed
- Define the conditions for a successfully completed puzzle

### Validate user input and provide feedback<a name="validate-user-input"></a>
- Check the validity of user input at each step and provide appropriate feedback
- Highlight any errors or conflicts in the user's input

## Additional Features<a name="additional-features"></a>
Consider adding additional features to enhance the Sudoku game. Tailwind CSS can help you style and customize these features efficiently. Consider the following steps:

### Implement timer and difficulty levels<a name="implement-timer-difficulty"></a>
- Add a timer to track the time taken to complete the puzzle
- Include different difficulty levels to challenge the players

### Track game statistics<a name="track-game-statistics"></a>
- Collect and display game statistics such as the number of games played, average completion time, etc.
- Provide insights into the player's progress and performance

### Add hints and option to generate new puzzles<a name="add-hints-generate-puzzles"></a>
- Allow users to request hints to help them solve the puzzle
- Provide an option to generate new puzzles for continuous gameplay

## Testing and Deployment<a name="testing-and-deployment"></a>
Write unit tests to ensure the correctness of your code. Deploy your application to a hosting platform like Vercel or Netlify for others to use and enjoy. Consider the following steps:

### Write unit tests<a name="write-unit-tests"></a>
- Create unit tests to verify the behavior and correctness of your code
- Test critical components and functionality, including puzzle generation, solving, and user interactions

### Deploy the application<a name="deploy-application"></a>
- Choose a hosting platform like Vercel or Netlify
- Set up the necessary deployment configurations and deploy your Sudoku game

Remember to break down the project into smaller tasks and work on them incrementally. This will help you manage complexity and make progress step by step. Good luck with your Sudoku project!
